🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Using Logistic Regression

In this project, I analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning. The key steps involved were:

📊 Data Collection and Preprocessing:

🔍 Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and missing values.
🧹 Handled missing values by dropping columns with excessive missing data and filling remaining gaps with mean/mode.
🔄 Converted categorical data into numerical format for model training.
📈 Data Analysis and Visualization:

🔍 Visualized survival rates based on gender, passenger class, and other features to identify key patterns and correlations.
📊 Explored the impact of gender and class on survival rates using bar plots and count plots.
🛠️ Feature Engineering:

🎯 Selected relevant features (Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked) for model training.
🔢 Encoded categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for machine learning algorithms.
🤖 Model Development:

📐 Used Logistic Regression to build a predictive model.
📊 Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to evaluate model performance.
📊 Model Evaluation:

✅ Achieved an accuracy of 81.46% on the training data and 78.21% on the test data.
📊 This demonstrates the model's ability to generalize well on unseen data.
This project provided hands-on experience in data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning model development. It also strengthened my skills in Python, pandas, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. 🚀💡🔍
